# Autonomous robots

.cols[
.c50[
Dangerous or inaccessible environments, where human operators cannot intervene

Robots should be:
- autonomous
- adaptable
- capable of **auto-fabrication** and re-use

# Modular (soft) robots

.cols[
.c50[

**Ideal** for auto-fabrication:
- all modules are virtually identical
- easy re-use
- compliance
- expressive control

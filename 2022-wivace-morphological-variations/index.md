# Scenario

autonomous reproduction of robots. are project image. maybe mars image.

---

# Limitations of morphogenesis

errors of assembly. image of badly assembled robots

---

# VSRs

ideal for auto-fabrication, because modules are virtually identical

---

# Precise RQ

---

# Experiment overview

---

# Req of experiment

---

# Background body

---

# Background distributed controller

---

# exp overview - precise

with sub-RQ on reopt

---

# modified shapes

---

# seeded re-optimization

---

# interesting shapes

hi, eric medvet. joint effort of stefano, ms students, and giorgia and federico, phd students

some or most of you know this video. it's part of a series of videos where robots are treated badly. beaten. it's fiction, no robot has been beaten for real.
yet, when we see this scene, we wonder what are the feeling of the robot. maybe we also wonder what will be the feelings of tomorrow descendant robots.
more broadly, if there will be an impact of this behavior on the species of robots.
fortunately, all of this is fiction, no real humans-robots interactions of this kind actually occurred, but...

# 3
... as humans, we constantly interact with non-biological, artificial agents. some of them are, somehow, plastic: that is, they can change in response to environmental conditions. and we, as humans, are part of their environment.
some of them are even designed right with the purpose of changing in response with interactions with humans.
here we can see a significant example. some years ago, ms developed a twitter bot with natural language interaction abilities and released it in the real world. basically, it was designed to interact with other twitter users and learn from those interaction.
the outcome was interesting. after a few hours, the nice, sweet personality to a nazi, antifeminist extremist.
so, interactions of artificial agents with humans matter...

# 4
... and a few big questions arise.
are we behaving well with artificial agents, that is, with alife?
are we influencing the way it develops and evolves?
are we aware of our impact?
these are huge questions, that are hard to be answered for countless reasons.

# 5
what we tried to do in this paper, is to humbly face these questions with a scientific methodology and some experiments, with the point of view of, broadly speaking, computer engineers.
in particular, [tell points]

# 6
the alife system has been the largest effor, because of the peculiar requirements of being influenceable by humans and adaptable, that is, plastic.
[tell points]

#7
we chose to populate our alife systems with some worm-like creatures that look for foods.
we chose this form as a good trade-off, in our opinion, between simplicity and appearance of being alive, mostly because of the body shape and kind of movement.
overall observing our artificial world should be like looking through a microscope in a sort-of solution populated by real micro-organisms.

#8
worms should look alive, that is, they should move, possibly according to their perception of the surrounding environment.
to this end, [tell points]

#9
the alife system has to be plastic. we chose to make it adaptable on the time scale of evolution. that requires for agents to die and be replaced by new agents.
the life cycle is regulated by energy. [tell points]

#10
concernign adaptation itself, it occurs because agents can vary across generations. in particular, they can differ in [tell points].
when inheriting the genotype from their parents, agents are subjected to an evolutionary pressure, that is, something that should drive the evolution of the system. we chose to build this pressure on the age of agents, on the assumption that long living worms are good at living, and hence better.

#11
the possibility to allow interactions between the real and artificial world was one of the key, and most peculiar, requirements of our alife system.
we classify interactions in two categories, depending on the direction of the flow of information, and hence potential causality: from real to artificial, and from artificial to real.
[tell points]
as you can see, humans can do two kind of explicit actions: good, feeding worms, and bad, killing them.
we introduced this sharp division to facilitate the analaysis of the experimental results.

#12
finally, after defining interactions, we needed a definition of influence, possibly in a way that allows measuring .
[tell points]

#13
ok, let's go the the experimental results.
the main result is, unfortunately, not as good as we hoped. despite the specific experiment design, we were not able to spot any clear influence of humans behavior on alife.
[describe plot]
[briefly discuss motivations]

#14
concerning the other direction of influence, as i said, we did a user study involving
[read numbers]

#15
here we present the most salient result.
the first one is about what humans thinks about artificial life: does it exist or not?
and do they behave accordingly to their opinion?
[comment plot: most say "exist" and are "involved"]


#16
another interesting observation concerns the actual behaviors we observed and their relation with intention.
[comment plot: no one planned a bad behavior, our humans were nice! also in practice]

#17
finally, one question is about the possibility that artificial creatures can be hurted and whether they can suffer. somehow, this closes the circle with the beaten robot video that we saw at the beginning of this talk.
as you can see, humans that do believe that creatures can suffer behave nicely with them.
the subjects that behaved the most badly were does without an opinion, and interestingly they also thought they did not hurt the worms!
we also investigated on why humans killed worms: some said because of curiositu, some for mistake, some also said that they thought they were eliminating worms that appeared to be not good enough. somehow disturbing...

#18
so, summarizing: there are more and more scenarios in which humans and artificial agents mutually interact and we, as humans, are for sure very influencing on agents, because we build, teach, and play with them.
however, characterizing and predicting the impact of our actions is hard.
fortunately, our user study suggests that we are, somehow, sensible to "wellness" of artificial life. and this is promising, in our opinion.

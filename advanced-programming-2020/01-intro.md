## Materials

Teacher slides:
- available [here](http://medvet.inginf.units.it/teaching/programmazione-avanzata-2019-2020)
- might be updated during the course

---

## Exam

Two ways:

1. project + written test + home assignments
  - grade: weighted average with weights 60%, 30%, 10%
2. project + written test + oral exam
  - grade: weighted average with weights 40%, 30%, 30%
  - fail if at least one part is graded <6/10

---

### Home assignments

Home assignments:
- short exercise assigned **during the course**
- will start in the classroom, under teacher's supervision
- student's output to be submitted within the **deadline**, one for each assignment
- grade, for each assignment:
  - 0/10: not submitted or missed deadline
  - up to 5/10: submitted, but not working
  - up to 8/10: submitted and almost working
  - 10/10: submitted and fully working
- grades communicated during the course

More details at first assignment.

### Project

Project:
- assigned at the end of the course
- student's output: software, tests, brief document
- to be submitted **within the exam date**
- grade:
  - 0/10: not submitted or missed deadline  
  - 5/10 to 10/10: submitted, depending on
    - quality of code
    - software structure
    - documentation
    - test coverage
    - degree of working

More details at project assignment.

### Written test and oral exam

Written test:
- a few questions with short open answers and short programming excercises

Oral exam:
- questions and short programming excercises

---

# Java: what and why?

---

## Why Java?

Practical motivations:
- write once, run everywhere
- large community support, solid tools, many APIs
- free

Teaching-related motivations:
- favors **abstraction**
- realizes many **key concepts** of programming and languages

---

## Language, platform

Java is both:
- a programming language
- a software platform

We will focus on:
- (mainly) the programming language
- (secondarily) the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE)

---

## Java platform

Mailnly composed of:
- an execution engine
- a compiler
- a set of specificications
- a set of libraries, with Application Program Interfaces (**APIs**)

Platforms (also **editions**) differ mainly in the libraries.
Most commont editions:
- Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE): for general-purpose, desktop applications
- Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE): J2SE + APIs/specifications for multi-tier client-server enterprise applications

---

## Main tools

What is needed for developing in Java?
- Java Development Kit (**JDK**), absolutely necessary
- documentation (javadoc)
- Integrated Development Environment (**IDE**)
  - many options
  - when used proficiently, makes development more efficient and effective

---

## Java IDEs

Many excellent options.

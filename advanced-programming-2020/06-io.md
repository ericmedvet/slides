## "Advanced" Input/Output (I/O)
### with streams

---

## Basic I/O

We already know how to do I/O
- of basic types (primitive and `String`s)
- from/to stdin/stdout

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
  new InputStreamReader(System.in)
);
/* ... */
String line = reader.readLine();
```

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
/* ... */
String s = scanner.next();
int n = scanner.nextInt();
double d = scanner.nextDouble();
```
What about other types and other source/target devices?

---

## Asbtraction: I/O stream

Stream: endpoints, direction, type of data
- a stream of X between A and B

Two basic models:
- **output** stream to device where data can be written as `byte[]`
- **input** stream from a device where data can be read as `byte[]`

]
]
]

---

## Interaction with a stream

Usage (key steps):
1. create the stream associating with the device
2. read or write `byte[]`

Device: file, "network", ...

---

## Beyond basic models

Other more complex models in which there is some **processing** of the data:
- compression/decompression of `byte[]`
- transformation of `byte[]` to/from other types
- ...

---

## `InputStream` and `OutputStream`

All I/O streams extend one between `InputStream` and `OutputStream`.

They can be composed:
- a stream can be build over another stream: the "result" is still a stream (of the same direction)
- data stream through streams .note[an instance of the **filter pattern**]

## Point of view of the "user"

No need to change the code .note[the "user" of the stream is a developer]:
- for **different devices** $\leftarrow$ polymorphism
- for **different processings** $\leftarrow$ polymorphism
- also for more complex (wrt `byte[]`) data types $\leftarrow$ composition

## How many I/O streams?

A lot!

We'll see a subset, for most common
- devices
- data transformation
- processing

### I/O of `byte[]`

---

## `OutputStream` class

.javadoc[
This **abstract** class is the superclass of all classes representing an output stream of bytes. An output stream **accepts output bytes and sends them to some sink**.
]

Methods:
.javadoc.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| void | close() | Closes this output stream and releases any system resources associated with this stream. |
| void | flush() | Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes to be written out. |
|static OutputStream| nullOutputStream() | Returns a new `OutputStream` which discards all bytes. |
| void | write​(byte[] b) | Writes `b.length` bytes from the specified byte array to this output stream. |
| void | write​(byte[] b, int off, int len) | Writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset `off` to this output stream. |
| abstract void | write​(int b) | Writes the specified byte to this output stream. |
]

- Writes only `byte[]`
- Subclasses take devices .note[`OutputStream` is abstract, cannot be instantiated]
  - `OutputStream.nullOutputStream()` gives a device discarding written `byte[]`

---

## Writing `byte[]`

`OutputStream` class:
.javadoc.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| void | write​(byte[] b, int off, int len) | Writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset `off` to this output stream. |

Writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset `off` to this output stream. The general contract for `write(b, off, len)` is that some of the bytes in the array `b` are written to the output stream in order; element `b[off]` is the first byte written and `b[off+len-1]` is the last byte written by this operation.
]

Other methods:
- `write(b)` is the same as `write(b, 0, b.length)`

---

## Use of `write()`

```java
byte[] data = /* ... */
OutputStream os = /* ... */
os.write(data, 0, 3); //`A`
os.write(data, 3, 5); //`B`
os.write(new byte[2]); //`C`
```

The device abstraction (might be a real device, or another `OutputStream`) of `os`:
- after A: contains 3 bytes; next write will start at 3 (0-indexes)
- after B: 5 bytes; **cursor** (= next write) at 5
- after C: 7 bytes; cursor at 7

.diagram.io.center[
cyl(0,10,160,60)
arrow(80,-10,60,30)
array(10,40,20,20,3,3)
cyl(200,10,160,60)

cyl(400,10,160,60)
arrow(480,-10,60,30)
array(410,40,20,20,7,7)
]

---

### Subclass of `OutputStream`

`write​(byte[] b, int off, int len)`
.javadoc[
**The general contract** for `write(b, off, len)` is that some of the bytes in the array `b` are written to the output stream in order; element `b[off]` is the first byte written and `b[off+len-1]` is the last byte written by this operation.
]

"The general contract is [...]": a message for:
1. the developer extending `OutputStream`
2. the curious user (another developer)
  - who can, in principle, ignore how the stream writes the data

`write(byte[] b)`
.javadoc[
**The general contract** for `write(b)` is that it should have exactly the same effect as the call `write(b, 0, b.length)`.
]

---

### Extending `OutputStream`

In principle, just `write(int b)` can be overridden!
.note[Actually, **must** be, we'll see...]
(In class description)
> Applications that need to define a subclass of `OutputStream` must always provide at least a method that writes one byte of output.

But: (In `write​(byte[] b, int off, int len)`)
> The `write` method of `OutputStream` calls the write method of one argument on each of the bytes to be written out. Subclasses are **encouraged** to override this method and provide a **more efficient** implementation.

---

### Internals

```java
public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) {
  for (int i = off; i<len; i++) {
    write(b[i]);
  }
}
```

> Subclasses are **encouraged** to override this method and provide a **more efficient** implementation.

Means:  
if there is a fixed cost (overhead) in writing on the device, regardless of data size, write more than one bytes at once

---

## Associating with a device

File:
```java
OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(/* ... */);
byte[] data = /* ... */
os.write(data);
```

Network (TCP):
```java
Socket socket = /* ... */
OutputStream os = socket.getOutputStream();
byte[] data = /* ... */
os.write(data);
```

Memory:
```java
OutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
byte[] data = /* ... */
os.write(data);
```

---

## `FileOutputStream`

.javadoc.head[
**Package** .pack[java.io]

.def[Class FileOutputStream]

.pack[java.lang.Object]  
.indent[].pack[java.io.OutputStream]  
.indent[].indent[]java.io.FileOutputStream
]
.javadoc[
A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a `File` or to a `FileDescriptor`. Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying platform. Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened for writing by only one `FileOutputStream` (or other file-writing object) at a time. In such situations the constructors in this class will fail if the file involved is already open.
]

"depends upon the underlying platform": there is still a physical machine under the JVM!

Constructors:
.javadoc.constructors[
| Constructor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| FileOutputStream​(File file) | Creates a file output stream to write to the file represented by the specified `File` object. |
| FileOutputStream​(File file, boolean append) | Creates a file output stream to write to the file represented by the specified `File` object. |
| FileOutputStream​(String name) | Creates a file output stream to write to the file with the specified name. |
| FileOutputStream​(String name, boolean append) | Creates a file output stream to write to the file with the specified name. |
]

---

## From `Socket`

`Socket` class:
.javadoc.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OutputStream | getOutputStream() | Returns an output stream for this socket. |
]

The user does not need to know the actual class of the output stream returned by `getOutputStream()`.

---

## `ByteArrayOutputStream`

.javadoc.head[
**Package** .pack[java.io]

.def[Class ByteArrayOutputStream]

.pack[java.lang.Object]  
.indent[].pack[java.io.OutputStream]  
.indent[].indent[]java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
]
.javadoc[
This class implements an output stream in which the data is written into a byte array. The buffer automatically grows as data is written to it. The data can be retrieved using `toByteArray()` and `toString()`.
]
.javadoc.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| int | size() | Returns the current size of the buffer. |
| byte[] | toByteArray() | Creates a newly allocated byte array. |
]

Usage:
```java
ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
byte[] data = /* ... */
baos.write(data);
byte[] written = baos.toByteArray();
System.out.println(Arrays.equals(data, written)); // -> true
```

Why? As a fake device, to do to `byte[]` conversion, ...

---

## End of Stream (EOS)

- A logical marker saying that there is no data after it
- Inserted by `close()`

```java
byte[] data = /* ... */
OutputStream os = /* ... */
os.write(data, 0, 3); //`A`
os.close(); //`B`
```
.diagram.io.center[
cyl(0,10,160,60)
arrow(80,-10,60,30)
array(10,40,20,20,3,3)
cyl(200,10,160,60)
arrow(280,-10,60,30)
array(210,40,20,20,4,'',3)
]

Usually, no other `write()` are possible after EOS has written.

---

### EOS and `close()`

From `OutputStream.close()`:
> Closes this output stream and releases any system resources associated with this stream. **The general contract** of `close` is that it closes the output stream. A closed stream cannot perform output operations and cannot be reopened.

> The `close` method of `OutputStream` does nothing.

`OutputStream` is the base class, no specific device:
- "system resources" are the device
- "Closing a `ByteArrayOutputStream` has no effect. The methods in this class can be called after the stream has been closed [...]"

---

## `InputStream` class

.javadoc[
This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing an input stream of bytes.
]

Methods (some):
.javadoc.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| abstract int | read() | Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. |
| int | read​(byte[] b) | Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array `b`. |
| int | read​(byte[] b, int off, int len) | Reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. |
]

- Reads only `byte[]`
- Subclasses take devices .note[`InputStream` is abstract, cannot be instantiated]
  - `InputStream.nullInputStream()` gives a device with no bytes to read (EOS is at position 0)

---

## Reading `byte[]`

.javadoc[
.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| int | read​(byte[] b, int off, int len) | Reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. |
]

Reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as `len` bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.
]

Attempt? We'll see...

Other methods:
- `read(b)` is the same as `read(b, 0, b.length)`
- ...

---

## Use of `read()`


```java
byte[] buffer = new byte[100];
InputStream is = /* ... */ //'A'
is.read(buffer, 0, 4); //`B`
is.read(buffer, 4, 5); //`C`
```

The device abstraction (might be a real device, or another `InputStream`) of `is`:
- after A: cursor at 0
- after B: cursor at 4
- after C: cursor at 5

---

### Input from files and `byte[]`

Input from file with `FileInputStream`:
- created with `FileInputStream(File file)` .note[we'll see a `File` is]
- the file exists, hence it has a size, hence a EOS

Input from `byte[]` with `ByteArrayInputStream`:
- created with `ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] data)`
- the data exists, hence it has a size, hence a EOS

---

### Output to files and `byte[]`

Output to file with `FileOutputStream`:
- created with, e.g., `FileOutputStream(File file, boolean append)`
- create the file (if not existing and possible), or write at the end of file $\rightarrow$ no limits to the writeable data!
  - possible limits related to underlying OS (obviously)

Output to `byte[]` with `ByteArrayOutputStream`:
- "The buffer automatically grows as data is written to it."

## `read()`

.javadoc[
.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| int | read​(byte[] b, int off, int len) | Reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. |
]

Reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as `len` bytes, but **a smaller number may be read**. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.

This method **blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected**, or an exception is thrown.

If `len` is zero, then no bytes are read and `0` is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value `-1` is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into `b`.
]

Attempt to read `len` bytes:
- if next byte in device is EOS, return -1
- if 0 bytes ready: block and wait for data
- if $\ge$ `len` ready, read `len` bytes and return `len`
- otherwise, read $n <$ `len` bytes and return $n$


---

### Example

Suppose the device:
- contains 5 bytes from time $t=0$ to $t=10$ (seconds)
- receives other 3 bytes, with a trailing EOS, at $t=10$

## Blocking `read()`

"The device receive": the `InputStream` receive for the underlying level, eventually from a physical devices

Keyboard $\rightarrow$ `InputStream System.in`
- the user types (and hit enter) $\rightarrow$ `InputStream` receives bytes

Network connection $\rightarrow$ `InputStream getInputStream()`
- data from the network arrives to this socket $\rightarrow$ receives bytes

---

## Internally

`read​(byte[] b, int off, int len)` in `InputStream`:
> The `read(b, off, len)` method for class `InputStream` simply calls the method `read()` repeatedly.

.javadoc[
.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| abstract int | read() | Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. |
]
Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an `int` in the range `0` to `255`. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value `-1` is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
]

`read()` read one `byte`, but returns an `int`: why?
- because the semantics of the return value includes a special value (`-1`) representing EOS
- domain of `byte` does not include `-1`

---

### `-1` in `read()` and `write()`

Other alternatives for representing EOS:
- returning a `Byte`, `null` for EOS
  - object creation overhead; uses heap, slower
- throwing an exception .note[we ignore exceptions now; we'll see]
  - EOS is not an exception, indeed; it's the norm

Java inventors **chose** to use an `int` as return value
- for consistency `read(byte[], int, int)` also returns an `int`
- for consistency `write(int)` in `OutputStream` takes an `int`!

.javadoc[
.methods[
| Mod. and Type | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| abstract void | write(int b) | Writes the specified byte to this output stream. |
]
Writes the specified byte to this output stream. The general contract for `write` is that one byte is written to the output stream. The byte to be written is the **eight low-order bits** of the argument `b`. The 24 high-order bits of `b` are ignored.
]

Methods for:
- removing, renaming, listing (`File` represents dirs too), ...

### Open with `FileOutputStream`

`FileOutputStream​(File file)` and `FileOutputStream​(String name)`:
- if `file`/`name` does not exist, creates new one .note[if OS says it's possible]
- puts the cursor at 0

$\rightarrow$ **existing content is cancelled**!
- if you want to append, use the constructors with `boolean append`!

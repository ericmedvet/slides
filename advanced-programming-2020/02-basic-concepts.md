# Basic concepts

## Hello goal!

```java
public class Greeter {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

Goal: **deep understanding** of this code
- not just what it "does"
- but the role of every part of the code

(Take code highlighting with care!)

---

## Objects

"Things" (entities that can be manipulated in the code) are **objects**
- objects exist
- but **do not have a name**

The code manipulates objects through **references**
- references have a symbolic name, called **identifier**

Both can be created.

## Creating objects and references

```java
String s;
```
- creates a reference with identifier `s` of type `String`
  - briefly: reference `s`
  - a reference has always a name!
- no object is created

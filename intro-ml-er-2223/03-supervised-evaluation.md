- $f(x)$ as a distribution over decision instead of decision
- how to obtain decision from distribution
- say that we'll discuss measures/methodology of quality on most common cases (on $Y$) based on $f(x)$ as distribution
- sketch on how to make the opposite: (dirac) distribution from decision

- premise: recall model of what and introduce system to be modeled and the case in which it also gives a distribution ($y=m'(x)$)
- discuss cases in which what happens is $x=m'(y)$ and phylosophical diffs: say it does not impact what follows
- go back to $m'$ and introduce *bayes classifier* in the context of classification: say it does errors even if perfect
- discuss bayes, its error, and their relation with $x$ with respect to the actual entity

- introduce the concept and the need for *baselines*
- give instances for regression and classification
- say bayes and baseline should be (soft) boundaries for ML system performance
- what performance? error, start introducing errors

- *classification error* and *accuracy*
- *weighted* accuracy for multiclass (maybe other measures)

- binary classification

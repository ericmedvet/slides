## What is Machine Learning?

- main def, highlight parts of definitions (science, computer, learn, without being explicitly programmed)
- one single example (spam)
- what does the def mean in practice? -> introduce decision

---

## Making a decision

- *problem*, *problem instance*, *solution*
- formalism showing input and output
- machine as executor of predict
- who writes the function predict? machine also in that part
- sketch of optimization problem
- search space and objective of optimization, broadly
- humans as optimizers
- other secondary objectives (cost, interpretability/explainability)

---

## Supervised vs. unsupervised learning

- *examples* as supervision

---

## Model

- focus on supervised: learning/*training* and *prediction* phases
- introduction of two functions
- *model*: of what?

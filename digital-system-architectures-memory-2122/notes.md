# Concepts to be explicitly delivered

## Primary
- Locality principle (spatial and temporal)
- Memory hierarchy, block (or line)
- Hit, miss, hit/miss rate, hit time, miss penalty

## Secondary
- SRAM, DRAM, Flash, HDD technicalities
- Stream benchmark

# Tentative plot
1. Show example code and highlight many access to memory
2. State two-fold goal: fast and large memory
3. Show technological bounds
4. Introduce books/library metaphor; mention hierarchy
5. Say we'll say how to do the same with computers, from two points of view: how to design/build them; how to exploit the way they are built while programming them
